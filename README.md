*This package was released before [Dart](http://www.dartlang.org) had
 [Streams](https://www.dartlang.org/docs/tutorials/streams/), if you're looking for 
 a Stream based solution, maybe this [implementation](https://github.com/julien/dart_mv/blob/master/lib/eventemitter.dart) 
 will suit your needs ...*
