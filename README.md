dart events
===========

[![](https://drone.io/julien/dart_events/status.png)](https://drone.io/julien/dart_events/latest)

A simple event system for [Dart](http://www.dartlang.org) based on
existing implementations done in JavaScript or ActionScript3.

*Available at the Dart [pub](http://pub.dartlang.org)*

**WARNING**
*I you're on the M2 version of Dart, you'll probably get
errors when importing the library because of the use of Streams
However, the compatible "M2" code is commented out so it's easy to make it 
working*
